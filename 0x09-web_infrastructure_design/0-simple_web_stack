Designing a One-Server Web Infrastructure for www.foobar.com
User Accessing www.foobar.com
User Request:

1. A user wants to access www.foobar.com.
Domain Name:

2. The user's computer asks the internet, "Where is www.foobar.com?".
DNS Resolution:

3. The Domain Name System (DNS) translates www.foobar.com to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).
Server Request:

4. The user's computer sends a request to the server at IP address 8.8.8.8.
Infrastructure Components


Components:
Server:
Physical or virtual machine handling requests and serving content.

Web Server (Nginx):
Handles incoming requests and serves static content.

Application Server:
Runs the application code, processes dynamic content, and communicates with the database.

Application Files (Code Base):
The code that runs the website's functionality.

Database (MySQL):
Stores and retrieves data for the application.


Roles:
What is a Server:
A computer that stores and manages data, serves requests, and hosts applications.

Role of Domain Name:
Acts as a human-readable address for the server's IP, making it easier for users to access websites.

DNS Record for www:
The "www" in www.foobar.com is a subdomain, and it's typically an alias (CNAME) record pointing to the main domain.

Role of Web Server (Nginx):
Manages incoming requests, serves static content, and acts as a reverse proxy to the application server.

Role of Application Server:
Executes the dynamic code, processes requests, and communicates with the database.

Role of the Database:
Stores and retrieves data for the application.

Communication with User's Computer:
Communication with the user's computer is facilitated through the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or its secure version (HTTPS).


Issues with the Infrastructure:
Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
The entire website depends on a single server. If it fails, the site goes down.

Downtime During Maintenance:
When deploying new code or performing maintenance, the web server needs to be restarted, causing downtime.

Scaling Limitations:
The infrastructure may struggle to handle high traffic. Scaling options are limited with a single server setup.


Steps to Address Issues:
Mitigate SPOF:
Introduce redundancy, consider load balancing, or explore cloud solutions for increased reliability.

Reduce Downtime During Maintenance:
Implement strategies like rolling deployments or use a second server for redundancy to avoid complete downtime during updates.

Scale for Traffic:
Consider distributing the workload by adding more servers, utilizing content delivery networks (CDNs), or adopting cloud-based solutions that allow easy scalability.
